This repository contains a **Real World Asset (RWA) contract** built on **Pinocchio**, leveraging **zero-copy techniques** for efficient data handling.

Instead of copying data between memory, heap, or stack, we directly **cast the data pointer to our struct layout**—avoiding overhead and improving performance.
⚠️ Note: When using zero-copy, always ensure that **struct alignment** is correct to avoid undefined behavior.

## ✨ Features

* 🔹 **Zero-Copy Access** – No unnecessary memory copying, faster contract execution.
* 🔹 **Pinocchio Optimized** – Uses the latest **Pinocchio Token Contract** standards.
* 🔹 **RWA Ready** – Designed for **Real World Asset** tokenization.
* 🔹 **Lightweight & Efficient** – Minimal overhead with performance in mind.

## 📖 How It Works

1. Define your struct layout.
2. Use a pointer cast to interpret account data as your struct (zero-copy).
3. Ensure alignment safety before dereferencing.
4. Build RWA logic on top of this optimized data access.
